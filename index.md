### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was a favorite as it was the first time we were introduced to the make command. Prior to this it took a lot longer to see if your labs were correct as you had to manually do test cases or push it to github.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was also a favorite as it was the first time using multiple files in a single project. It tought me a lot about how certain files interact with our program and how they can be used to your advantage.

* Lab 10

    Finally lab 10 was also a favorite as it was the first time we used 2d vectors. In the project we took a list of all counties in california along with their population and created a program that allowe d you to input the name of the county and find out the population
